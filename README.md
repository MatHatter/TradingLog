# TradingLog
Trading Log is an organizational and risk analytic tool to help traders trade better.

A trading log could be useful for a trader to refer back to their trades to see where they went right or wrong. Most sensible traders will not trade a trade unless the reward to risk ratio is >= 3:1. However, this ratio is subjective to one's trading style.

Risk can be lessened if the trader decides to enter a stoploss.

Future edits could include:

> trailing stops percentages
> charts/graphs
> more colors
> printer friendly format
> error handling (most important ones have been fixed.)
> Non-profitable trades with stops caluation configuration
> Describe the color changes in font for stops capturing profit.
> Put in quote about typical reward to risk ratio for a risk-off trader.

It is up to you what you do with it, but the basics are there to keep track of your trades if you want it.
